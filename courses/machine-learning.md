#### Course Information

- Machine learning is the study of algorithms and statistical methods that computers use to "learn" patterns and inferences in order to perform a specific task without explicit instruction. This course mainly aims at providing mathematical/statistical methods, which are essential in machine learning. A wide range of topics will be covered, including but not limited to density estimation, Bayes decision theory, latent variable models, mixture models, discriminant analysis, clustering, classification, dimensionality reduction, regression, kernel methods, VC-dimension, HMM, MLP, and RBF.
