#### Professor
- Youngseok Kim (POSTECH)

#### Course Information

- According to UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 
“The practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all.”
“Adequate facilities and equipment are essential to physical education and sport.”
(International Charter of Physical Education and Sport, Paris, 21 Nov. 1978) As above, sport is a key element to lead a healthy and happy life for us; it is our basic rights. Sport makes our lives healthy, and in turn, mentally wealthy. Then, “how” can we promote sports activities in our lives? This class is trying to find the answer in the convergence engineering of sports and ICT. 

- Sports = all forms of usually competitive physical activity 

- Engineering = Technical application of math and physics to solve problems

- Sports engineering is concerned with the research and development of technologies for the sports industry.

- “Engineering skill first and knowledge of sport thereafter.”

Class Objectives:
- To understand a paradigm shifting in sports industry: providing the integrated knowledge of state-of-the-art science & technology into sports required to open up new frontiers of sports industry.
- To perform pioneering research to solve difficult unmet needs for sports industry: multidisciplinary research with imagination in the fields of sports and engineering knowledge that can provide solutions possible to be applied in creative and ingenious ways.
- To cultivate talented individuals who lead the future IT industry: develop and demonstrate the creative solutions via teamwork.
